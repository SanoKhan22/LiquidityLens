# Competitive Analysis

## 🏆 The Core Differentiator: "Market DVR"
The single biggest difference is the **Market DVR (Digital Video Recorder)** feature.
*   **Everyone else** (Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood) shows you the **current price**. If the market crashes, you only see the aftermath.
*   **LiquidityLens** records the last **5 minutes** of high-frequency order book data. It allows users to **rewind and replay** the crash to see exactly *who* sold, *where* the liquidity vanished, and *how* the price collapsed.

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown

### 1. vs. Exchange Apps (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)
*   **The Gap:** Exchange apps are designed for *execution* (buying/selling), not *analysis*. They show a simple list of numbers for the order book, which is impossible to read during fast market moves.
*   **LiquidityLens Advantage:** Visualizes the order book as a **Heatmap**. Instead of reading numbers, you see "walls" of color. You can instantly spot support and resistance levels that are invisible on standard apps.

### 2. vs. TradingView
*   **The Gap:** TradingView is the king of *charts* (candlesticks, indicators), but it has very poor support for *Order Flow* (Level 2 data) on mobile. It doesn't show the live liquidity changes that drive price.
*   **LiquidityLens Advantage:** Focuses 100% on **Order Flow**. It complements TradingView rather than replacing it. Traders use TradingView to see the trend, and LiquidityLens to see the immediate buying/selling pressure.

### 3. vs. Bookmap (The Closest Competitor)
*   **The Gap:** Bookmap is the industry standard for order book visualization, but it is a **heavy, expensive desktop software** ($100/month) meant for professional desk traders with multiple monitors.
*   **LiquidityLens Advantage:** It is **"Bookmap for your pocket."** It brings 80% of Bookmap's value (visualization + heatmap) to a mobile interface for **Free / Open Source**, targeting the casual/retail trader who trades from their phone.
